# coderef

[Release website](https://mboworks.github.io/coderef/)

Regex-driven references in source code — resolved, click-opened, and
verified identically from VSCode and from CI. A `.coderef.jsonc` config
declares the patterns; the same engine runs inside the editor (via WASM,
in-process) and inside the Rust CLI binary (for `pre-commit` and CI).

The working specification is [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md); this README is
the elevator pitch.

```python
# Click-to-open in VSCode; verified by pre-commit; same regex engine in both.
#
# TODO(@marcus): swap to argon2id — JIRA(SEC-87) tracks it.
# DOCREF(/docs/security/hashing) explains the threat model.
# RFC(8259) is the JSON spec.

# IfChange / ThenChange enforces co-modification across files:
# IfChange('hash-params')
HASH_PARAMS = {"memory_kib": 19456, "iterations": 2, "parallelism": 1}
# ThenChange(/docs/security.md:hash-params, /tests/test_auth.py:hash-params)
```

Patterns declare their regex, the URL or local-file they resolve to,
how they're verified, what category they belong to, and what should
happen on hover. Same regex flavour, same semantics, in both hosts.

## Planning horizon

| Version  | Theme                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **v0.1** | Minimum viable: pattern engine + HTTP verifier + click-to-open. WASM-shared core (no engine divergence between editor and CLI).                                                                                                    |
| **v0.2** | Coupled-change (`IfChange`/`ThenChange`) + categories + references browser + commit-message linting + anchor verification for in-repo Markdown + block-on-marker (`DO NOT COMMIT` / `NOCOMMIT` source guards via `kind: "block"`). |
| **v0.3** | Multi-target references + full network profiles + auto-upgrade codemod (`coderef upgrade`) + visual config editor + external-URL anchor verification.                                                                              |
| **v0.4** | LSP server mode + composable coupled-change IDs + git-submodule pass-through.                                                                                                                                                      |

Anything past v0.4 is deliberately not planned in detail (see
[`DESIGN.md` §20.5](./DESIGN.md)). The full per-version scope is in
[`DESIGN.md` §20](./DESIGN.md).

## Repo layout

- [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) — the working spec. Source of truth.
- [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) — conventions every contributor (human or
  AI agent) follows. Includes the markdown table-alignment rule and a
  pointer to the script that enforces it.
- [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — entry-point for Claude Code; redirects
  to `AGENTS.md`.
- [`tools/align-md-tables.py`](./tools/align-md-tables.py) — the
  table-alignment script.
- [`.coderef.jsonc`](./.coderef.jsonc) — the project's own coderef
  config; the engine dogfoods against this on every CI run.
- [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) — Apache 2.0.

## Pre-commit hooks (v0.1)

The `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` declares the hook *shape* consumers
will install once the npm wrapper ships a binary (v0.2). For v0.1
the dogfood-able path is `language: system` against a locally-built
binary; see [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml)
for the working example used by this repo's own CI:

```yaml
- id: coderef-doctor
  entry: cargo run --quiet --release --bin coderef -- doctor --no-scan .
  language: system

- id: coderef-check
  entry: cargo run --quiet --release --bin coderef -- check .
  language: system
```

## What `coderef` is *not*

- Not a TODO tracker — it resolves the references you put in source,
  it doesn't manage them.
- Not a tag-uniqueness enforcer ([`tagref`](https://github.com/stepchowfun/tagref)
  already covers that niche).
- Not a generic markdown link checker
  ([`lychee`](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) covers that).
- Not an AST-aware refactoring tool — `coderef upgrade` is regex-only
  by design; for AST work, use jscodeshift / ast-grep / comby.

See [`DESIGN.md` §23](./DESIGN.md) for the full out-of-scope list and
the reasoning.
